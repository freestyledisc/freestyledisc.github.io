# 2.1 An overview of Freestyle Competition

**In general:** In competitive freestyle, teams of freestylers are judged based on the difficulty, variety, artistry, and
execution of routines.

**Divisions:** Competitions are divided into divisions based on team composition: Open Pairs, Open Coop, Mixed
Pairs, and Women’s Pairs. All pairs divisions consist of two-person teams performing 3-minute routines. The Open
Coop division consists of three-person teams performing 4-minute routines. Routines are usually set to music. Any
player may enter up to 3 rounds of competition.

**Rounds:** Each division is divided into rounds of competition—like quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. The number
of rounds per division is determined based on the number of teams who compete in the division. The more teams,
the more rounds of competition.

**Pools:** In each round, the teams are divided into pools. Teams compete within each pool to advance to the next
round.

**Example:** The open pairs semi-finals consist of 2 pools of 8 teams. The top 4 ranked teams in each pool
advance to the finals. The finals consist of one pool of 8 teams. The winner of the division is determined by the
highest ranked team in the finals.

**Seeding:** The composition of the pools is determined through a seeding process. The seeding process sorts teams
based on expected competitive strength. The purpose of seeding is to ensure that the pools are (relatively) equally
competitive. In the first round of a division, seeding is based on the current ranking or rating of the players on
each team. In later rounds, seeding is on the results of prior rounds. In general, seeding also determines play
order: Higher seeded teams perform after lower seeded teams.

**Advancing:** A set number of the teams in each pool advance to the next round based on the scores they receive
from the judges. The number of teams that advance depends on the division, the round, and the number of teams
in the pool. In general, half the teams are cut and half the teams advance from each pool in each round. After the
first round in a division, teams are sorted into pools based on their performance

**Ranking Teams:** In each round of competition, teams are ranked by summing each judge’s category score.
Teams with higher aggregate scores are ranked higher than teams with lower aggregate scores. Each round is
scored independently, a team’s score in a prior round does not carry over to later rounds. The winner of each
division is the team with the highest score in the final round.

## 2.1.1 What the Judges Evaluate
Judges evaluate each team’s routine in three categories: (1) Difficulty, (2) Variety, and (3) Artistry. The Artistry
category includes 4 unique subcategories: (1) Execution, (2) Teamwork, (3) Musical Choreography, and (4) Form.
All categories include a “General Impression” subcategory.
Judges do not evaluate every category. Instead, judges are assigned to one category.

## 2.1.2 How Many Judges are on the Judging Panel
The FPA requires a certain number of judges to evaluate each round of competition. The number of judges
depends on whether the FPA has designated a tournament a “Major” competition. Major competitions include,
among others, the World Championship, European Championship, and American Championship.

For Major competitions, the FPA requires a panel of nine judges. For non-Major competitions, the FPA recommends
but does not require a panel of nine judges. Six judges may be used instead.

Judges are assigned evenly to the categories. Accordingly, a 9-judge panel consists of 3 Difficulty judges, 3 Artistry
judges, and 3 Variety judges. A 6-judge panel consists of 2 Difficulty judges, 2 Artistry judges, and 2 Variety
judges

## 2.1.3 How Long Are Routines
**Routine Length:** Routines must be a specified period of time. The specified period of time is determined by the
division.

- Pairs division routines (Open, Mixed, Women’s) must be **3 minutes**.
- Coop division routines must be **4 minutes**.

**Penalty for Short or Long Routines:** There is a penalty for routines that are either too short or too long. For
every five seconds that a routine is too short or too long, there is a .3 deduction from the team’s total score.

**Grace Period:** Teams receive a 5 second grace period before or after the required routine length. That is, teams
may end a routine within 5 seconds of the required routine length without penalty.

Examples:
- Ex. 1: A pairs team that ends at 2:55 is not penalized due to the grace period.
- Ex. 2: A pairs team that ends at 3:05 is not penalized due to the grace period.
- Ex. 3: A pairs team that ends at 2:54 is penalized with a .3 deduction from their execution score in the Artistry category.
- Ex. 4: A pairs team that ends at 3:06 is penalized with a .3 deduction from their execution score in the Artistry category.
- Ex. 5: A pairs team that ends at 2:50 is penalized with a .6 deduction from their execution score in the Artistry category.
- Ex. 6: A pairs team that ends at 3:10 is penalized with a .6 deduction from their execution score in the Artistry category.

Artistry judges must input the penalty manually.

**Grace Period Applies to Category Scores:** Judges may score move or move combinations that occur within the
grace period: Difficulty judges can judge any part of a phrase that occurs within the grace period; Variety judges
can increment variety components; and all judges can consider move and move combinations in the grace period
for their other aspects of judging.
