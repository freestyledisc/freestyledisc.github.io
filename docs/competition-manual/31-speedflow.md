# 3.1 Explanation of Speed Flow
In Freestyle Disc, Speed Flow refers to a quick exchange of the disc from throw to catch. In most cases, this
means that a player throws the disc to his partner who does a trick catch directly off the throw. Usually, players
will stand at least a few meters apart from each other, but this doesn’t have to be the case. Also small
manipulations of the disc are allowed between the throw and the catch and it can still be called Speed Flow. The
key criterion of a Speed Flow is that the disc continues or “flows” from throw to catch without significant delays or
pauses.

Examples of speed flow:
- Player A does a forehand throw, Player B does a UTL catch directly off that throw.
- Player A does a backhand throw up in the air and to his right, Player B extends the flight of the disc by
brushing it directly off the throw to Player C who does a scarecrow catch of this brush.
- Player A does an overhand throw to Player B who deflects the disc with his hand and then does a lacer catch
directly off this deflection.
- Player A throws a bounce throw to Player B who does an UTL tip of this throw and catches the disc off this tip.

The difficulty of Speed Flow elements depends on:
- The difficulty of the throws
- The difficulty of the catches
- The difficulty of the deflections, brushes, and/or tips done between the throw and the catch
- The speed of exchanges: Quick throws are more risky than slow throws; short breaks between catch and
throw are more risky than long breaks.

In general Speed Flow is more difficult than it appears, because it contains a high number of catches, and catches
are usually the most risky part of each combo.
