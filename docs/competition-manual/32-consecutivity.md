# 3.2 Explanation of Consecutivity
Consecutivity is the ideal of transitioning directly from restricted move to restricted move. One trick becomes a
direct set up for the next trick. Consecutivity refers to linking moves together rather than breaking up combinations
with basic moves. Consecutivity adds to the difficulty and visual appeal of play. Going from a restricted move
directly to another restricted move builds consecutivity. "Resetting" a combination with an unrestricted move
breaks the consecutivity of the combination.

An unrestricted move is a basic skill like the nail delay held in front of the body. There is no contortion or physical
challenge adding to the difficulty of the skill. We use the nickname THE delay for this move.

Examples of restriction:
- Movement: Spinning the body. Going airborne.
- Limb/Torso: Reaching around a body part to set, delay, pull or catch the disc. Behind the back pull. Set under
the leg.
- Body position: Use of unconventional arm positions (e.g., inverting the hand) or different body parts (e.g.,
  elbow or toe delay) to perform a skill.
- Sight: Performing tricks without sight of the disc (e.g., phlaud catch)
- Technical: Performing manipulations of the disc that defy gyroscopic expectations. Against the spin moves.
  Turnovers. Spin changes. Angle changes. Some uses of third world or benign (no spin) tricks.
- Distraction: Using multiple discs at the same time by juggling or using one disc to perform a skill with a
  second disc.
- Cooperative: Using another player's body as a restriction. Set under a teammate's leg.

It is more consecutive to go from a restricted set to a restricted reception. Flowing from reception to set (or set to
reception) improves consecutivity. A set does not need to be restricted to preserve consecutivity, as long as the
flow of the combination continues. A pause in flow before an unrestricted set can break a streak of consecutivity.

Evaluating the consecutivity of body rolls and brushing: Consecutivity is an ideal founded on delay-based freestyle.
Its ideals can be applied to body rolls (back rolls, rolls received or set under a leg) or air brushing (brushing under
the leg, with a knee), but the standard for consecutivity is more around repetition and flow. For example, a
completely consecutive air brushing sequence would consist of only restricted brushes, but brushing several times
in a row still demonstrates some consecutivity because each move flows to the next without a reset.

Examples for different levels of consecutive combos:
- No consecutivity - The transition from one restricted move to the next is interrupted by a THE delay: THE
  delay  unrestricted set  a single spin  THE delay  under the leg tip  THE delay  behind the
  back catch.
- Some consecutivity - Some moves in the combination link together. Others are interrupted:
  THE delay  grapevine set  behind the back pull  THE delay  flamingo catch.
- High consecutivity - Most or all moves in the combination link together: Under the leg reception
  off a throw  grapevine set  behind the head rim pull  under the leg rim pull  scarecrow catch
