# 3.3 Music Choreography: Points to Consider
Points to consider when judging Music Choreography:
- Does the speed of play matches the speed of the music? Are changes in speed of the music reflected in
changes in the speed of play? Pauses in play that match pauses in the music should be rewarded.
- Does the team hit music hits or breaks? Closely missed attempts to hit music hits or breaks should also be
rewarded, but less so.
- Are recurring music elements interpreted, e.g., through a tipping sequence? Repetition of moves can be
rewarded in such interpretive cases.
- Expressive styles of play should be rewarded more than less expressive ones if the teamâ€™s artistic expression
matches the music. This can also include purposefully not matching the music.
- Do not give a score based on whether or not you like the music!
