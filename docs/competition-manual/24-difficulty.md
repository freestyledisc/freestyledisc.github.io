# 2.4 Difficulty
Difficulty judges score the difficulty of moves and move combinations. They put in numerical scores 1-10 with half
point increments (like 5.5 or 8.5) for each phrase. Those phrase scores are then summed and each judge’s scores
are averaged into a final difficulty score for the team’s routine.
Difficulty judges, like all other judges, also provide a score for general impression. Difficulty judges may consider
factors other than difficulty in providing a general impression score.

## 2.4.1 What factors determine difficulty
Difficulty is determined by many factors. Judges may consider, for example:
- The skill and effort required to learn a move or combination.
- The skill and effort required to perform a move or combination.
- The risk of attempting a move or combination.
- The precision demonstrated in executing the move or combination.
- The form displayed in executing the move or combination.
- The physicality or athleticism of the move or move combination.
- The coordination and timing required to perform cooperative (teamwork) aspects of a move or combination.
- The consecutivity of the move or move combination. (Consecutivity is defined below)

## 2.4.2 Difficulty is relative.
Judges input difficulty scores for each phrase based on a 1-10 scale, where 1 represents “easy” move
combinations and 10 represents “difficult” move combinations.
Judges should try to use the entire scale each round. To achieve this, they should mentally set a difficulty scale
before each round based on the expected competitive strength of the round. A 5-score combination in the open
pairs division may be a 10-score combination in the junior division.

## 2.4.3 Judges may consider attempted moves
Judges should consider moves that are completed or attempted.

**Relationship with Execution:** Difficulty scores will reflect execution to some degree: A completed move should
receive a higher difficulty score than an attempted move if all else is equal. Judges should provide difficulty scores
that reflect the degree to which a move was successful or unsuccessful: A nearly successful move should score
higher than one that was not close to being successful. Difficulty judges should keep in mind, however, that
execution is scored separately.

## 2.4.4 Phrasal Scoring
Difficulty judges score “phrases.” In general, a “phrase” encompasses the combination of moves from the throw to
the catch.

**Non-Standard Phrases:** In some instances, phrases may involve move combinations that do not include throws
or catches. In those instances, judges should use their discretion to determine phrases based on natural starting
(beginning of disc movement) and ending points (end of disc movement), recognizing that judges should be
cautious about identifying phrases that are unusually long (more than fifteen seconds) or short (less than one
second).

**Quick Catch or Speed Flow Phrases:** In quick catch or speed flow sequences, each throw and catch
combination is its own phrase.

**Incomplete Phrases:** Judges should input scores even for incomplete phrases. A wild throw should receive an
input score. This is not to punish the team but to make sure they receive a phrase for the purposes of the catch
percentage multiplier.

## 2.4.5 How Phrases turn into difficulty scores
Difficulty judges are tasked only with putting in difficultly scores for each phrase. The electronic judging system
then sums those difficulty scores after applying certain multipliers.

Difficulty judges should not try to anticipate the electronic judging system in inputting their scores. They should
simply judge each phrase and assign a score between 1 and 10. The multipliers are intended to and designed to
apply on top of Judges’ base scores.

**Exponential Multiplier:** The electronic judging system applies an exponential multiplier to the raw difficulty
scores. This scale “stretches” the range of difficulty scores to give more weight to high scores and less weight to
low scores. That means the gap between a 9 and a 10 is far greater than the gap between a 1 and a 2. This
reflects the fact that achieving a difficulty score on the higher end of the difficulty scale is exponentially harder
than achieving a difficulty score on the lower end of the difficulty scale.

Example:

_Without Multiplier:_ The judge scores one phrase 10 and another phrase 2. The raw score for those two phrases is 12.

_With Multiplier:_ The judge scores one phrase 10 and another phrase 2. The raw score for those two phrases is 12.
Once the exponential multiplier is applied, the 10 becomes a 15 and the 2 becomes a 1.5. The modified raw score is 17.5.

*The exact scale is subject to change.

The purpose of the non-linear difficulty scale is to recognize that more difficult moves are generally exponentially
harder than less difficult moves and judges struggle to input raw scores that reflect exponential differences.

### Excess Phrase Multiplier:
Each judge’s final difficulty score for each team is the sum of all that team’s phrase scores. Only some of the
phrase scores receive full weight. The rest receive
very little and diminishing weight. (All phrases count equally
toward the catch percentage discount in the execution subcategory of Artistry.)

- In a 3-minute routine, the 12 highest-scored combinations receive the full value. Combinations after those 12 receive diminishing —and very little— value.
- In a 4-minute routine, 16 highest-scored combinations receive the full value. Combinations after those 16 receive diminishing —and very little— value. 

Examples: Assume 3-minute routines.
- _Before weighing:_ The judge scores 20 phrases. Half of the phrases receive a score of 5 and the other half receive a score of 10. The final difficulty score is 150.
- _After weighing:_ The judge scores 20 phrases. Half of the phrases receive a score of 5 and the other half receive a score of 10. The 10 scores are higher than the 5 scores, so all 10 of them receive full weight. Two of the 5 scores also receive full weight. The top 12 combinations receive a raw score of 110. The other eight 5 scores receive only partial weight and together add 5 points. The final difficulty score is 115. 

_Purpose:_ In simplified terms, teams receive full difficultly scores for the most difficulty combinations—the 12 most 
difficult in 3-minute routines, and the 16 most difficult in 4-minute routines. All “excess” combinations provide only 
small additions to a team’s difficultly score. The system is designed to reward a balance of quality and quantity. 

It addresses two problems:

- _Quality Problem:_ If difficulty scores are averaged, then teams with low difficultly phrases but higher overall difficultly will lose to teams without low difficulty phrases. Example: Team 1 performs a routine with high difficulty phrases A, B, and C. Team 2 performs a routine with high difficulty phrases A, B, and C, but also performs additional low difficulty phrases X, Y, and Z. If the difficulty scores are averaged, Team 2 will have a lower final difficultly score than Team 1 even though Team 2 performed all the same combinations as Team 1.
- _Quantity Problem:_ If all difficultly scores were summed, then teams could perform unlimited numbers of low difficulty combinations to achieve a high difficulty score. 

Note: As explained below, a “catch percentage” multiplier is applied to execution scores based on the number of “phrases” 
in a routine. The more phrases in a routine, the smaller the execution penalty for each error. The number of phrases is 
determined based on the number of difficulty scores input by the difficulty judges, each of which reflects a phrase. 
For this reason, difficulty judges should put in difficulty scores for every completed or attempted phrase, even if it 
is only an attempted move or combination. For instance, if a player misthrows the disc onto the ground, difficulty judges 
should give that phrase a score, even if it is a 0.

## 2.4.6 Timing
Difficulty scores may be awarded for up to five seconds after the time limit for the routine has passed. Judges may
award scores for the part of a combination that occurred before the five seconds after the time limit has passed.
