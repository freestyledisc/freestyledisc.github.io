# 2.2 The Weight of Category Scores
A teamâ€™s final score is the weighted sum of its subscores in each category and subcategory. The component scores
are weighted to ensure consistency: The value range of difficulty scores should be consistent with the value range
of Artistry scores.

Each of the following groups is weighed separately:
- Difficulty
- Teamwork, Music Choreography, and Form (that is Artistry without Execution)
- Variety
- General Impression
- Execution
