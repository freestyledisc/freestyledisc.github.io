# 2.5 Artistry

## 2.5.1 General
Artistry is a category that consists of: (1) Teamwork, (2) Music Choreography, (3) Form, and (4) Execution.
Judges provide a 0-10 score in each of Teamwork, Music Choreograph, and Form. Execution is judged by
deducting points for execution errors from the team’s final score.

## 2.5.2 Execution: In General
Judges penalize errors in execution. Execution errors may occur when a player fails to properly perform the move
they intend to perform: Drops, bobbles, misthrows, and pauses may all be execution errors. Execution errors may
also occur when a player properly performs a move they clearly did not intend to perform: THE catches, re-revving
brushes, “bail” catches, or obvious “saves” may all warrant execution deductions.
Execution judges should be extremely demanding and consistent. If Execution judges do not penalize “small” or
“minor” errors they are ultimately penalizing teams who execute their routines without small errors. It is not
unusual for execution judges to have 20-30 “minor” execution deductions.

## 2.5.3 Execution: Catch Percentage Multiplier
A “catch percentage” multiplier is applied to execution scores based on the number of “phrases” in a routine. The
more phrases in a routine, the smaller the execution penalty for each error after the multiplier is applied. For
example, if two teams have the same base execution score, but one team has more phrases than the other, the
team with more phrases will have a higher/better overall execution score than the team with less phrases. This
multiplier equalizes execution so that teams are not punished for attempting more combinations.
Execution judges do not have to count phrases. The number of phrases is drawn from the difficulty scores, as
explained above.
Example: Team 1 has 5 .3 deduction drops in a routine with 15 phrases. Their raw execution deduction is -1.5 and
their adjusted execution deduction is -1. Team 2 has 5 .3 deduction drops in a routine with 50 phrases. Their raw
execution deduction is -1.5 and their adjusted execution deduction after applying the catch percentage multiplier is -.375.

## 2.5.4 Execution: Deductions
Judges deduct for execution errors. The worse the error, the larger the deduction.
The judging system provides three increments of deductions:
- .3 (Major Error)
- .2 (Intermediate Error)
- .1 (Minor Error)

Judges may use these increments or any combination of these increments to deduct for execution errors. As a
guiding principle, a typical drop warrants a .3 deduction.

Judges should note that it is common to combine execution deductions to reflect multiple errors in the same
combination or extraordinary execution errors that warrant a higher deduction than a single .3 deduction permits.

For example:
- A wild throw may warrant a deduction significantly higher than .3 deductions.
- A re-rev sequence might require multiple .1 or -.2 deduction as the re-rev sequence continues or even multiple .3 deductions.
- A failed catch attempt that starts as a .2 or .3 deduction might require more deductions if the player continues to “bat” at the disc.

The guiding principle should be consistency and relativity. A judge who provides a .3 deduction for a drop that is
quickly recovered should provide a higher deduction for a drop that results in the disc spinning away from the
player.

**Intent is the Guiding Principle:** Players should be judged on their intent. Bobbles, THE delays, wobbles,
re-revving, and even “saves” may constitute execution errors if they were not what the player intended.

**Breaks in Flow Warrant Execution Deductions:** Judges should deduct for any and all breaks in flow.

## 2.5.5 Artistic Impression: Teamwork
In the Teamwork category, judges evaluate the quality and quantity of co-ops and speed-flow segments. Judges
should place special emphasis on the quality of the co-ops.

## 2.5.6 Artistic Impression: Music Choreography
In the Music Choreography category, judges evaluate the team's relationship to the style and content of their
music. Judges should not let their own musical tastes dictate the score, but judges should consider how the team
interacts with the music.
Routines that hit key breaks in the music or that show a well-established relationship to the style and content of
the music should be rewarded more than a routine that shows no relationship to the music.
Music before play beings: Judges should not consider choreography performed unrelated to disc movement, before
the first throw or disc movement, or after the grace period.

## 2.5.7 Artistic Impression: Form
Judges should evaluate the extent to which the team incorporates appealing, confident, and purposeful body
positioning, as opposed to haphazard or sloppy body positioning.
