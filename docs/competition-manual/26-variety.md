# 2.6 Variety

## 2.6.1 General
Variety reflects how many kinds of disc manipulations and physical interactions a team uses. The main purpose is
to avoid or reduce repetition. Judge the routine as a series of ideas. Note whether the team presents a series of
unique ideas (a high score) or the same idea over and over (a low score). An idea can be a throw, a catch, a
dramatic event involving the disc, or a consecutive portion of a combination. Focus closely on how each move is
performed, as repeating the same move with different hands or spins or with an upside down disc is not
necessarily repetitive. Purposeful repetition must be considered carefully. It should not be penalized as long as
variety is demonstrated within the routine. 

Variety is judged through two components: a “quantity” and a “quality” component. The quantity score reflects
how many individual unique components a team performed. The quality score reflects the depth, skill, and
aptitude of a team’s variety. The quality score is a multiple applied to a team’s quantity score.

## 2.6.2 Quantity Score
The quantity score requires the judge to press an “increment” button each time a new element is introduced into a
routine. Every new throw, move, catch, direction, side, or other component involving the disc receives an
increment.

**Types of Variety:** There are many types of variety that a team may introduce. The following provide a
non-exhaustive examples of variety.

- Throws: Variations include use of different throws, grips, and hands.
- Catches: Variations include different catches and different performance of catches (leaping vs. standing; right leg or hand vs. left hand or leg).
- Disc handling: Variations include basic disc manipulations (control moves, brushing, angle adjustments, turnovers, rolls, deflections, etc.).
- Styles of play: Variations include diversity of freestyle elements (multiple disc, juggling, padiddling, twirling, speed flow etc.).
- Spin directions, Ambidexterity: Variations include the use of both hands and the use of both spins (clock and counter). 

The same move with a different hand or a different spin may warrant a variety increment. The same moves by different players on the team does not warrant a variety increment.

## 2.6.3 Quality Score
The quality component of the variety score is a single score that reflects three considerations: (1) variety of move
types demonstrated; (2) the amount of skill in each move type demonstrated; and (3) BSAA (“both spins any
angle”) aptitude.

The first factor--the variety of move types demonstrated--measures the number of moves performed across
different categories of moves, like throws, catches, rolls, skids, turnovers, tips, kicks, and brushes. It is
distinguishable from the quantity score because the focus is not just on the variety of moves (which could occur in
a single category like throws), but the variety of moves that show different skill sets.

The second factor--amount of skill in each move type demonstrated--measures the depth and difficulty
demonstrated in each move category. It is meant to prevent players from applying a “checklist” approach to variety
by doing a series of simple moves in each category. Although it overlaps with difficulty, it rewards difficulty
achieved through different skill sets.

The third factor--BSAA aptitude--measures the balance of a routine along three dimensions: (1) clock-counter, (2)
upside down-right side up, and (3) vertical-flat.

A few examples help explain the purpose of these changes:
- Ex. Team A does 25 different unique skids. Team B does 25 unique moves including skids, turnovers, 
centerwork, rolls, kicks, guides, and throws. Team A and B would have the same increment score, but
Team B would have a significantly higher quality score.
- Ex. Team A does a Throw, Pull, Bad Attitude Hold, Shoot, Chair. Team B does a Throw, Right Hand Tip,
  Left Hand Tip, BTB Tip, Chair.
- Both teams have a quantity score of 5. Team A’s quality score will be higher than Team B’s quality score.
  This is because Team A’s moves are different types of moves versus Team B’s move which are all forms of
  tips.
- Ex. Team A does 10 unique clock skids 10 unique counter skids. Team B does 20 unique clock skids. Team
  A’s quality score will be higher than Team B’s quality score.
- Ex. Team A does a backhand throw, an under-the-leg pull, and an under-the-leg catch. Team B does a UD
  behind-the-back throw, to a juice pull, to a gitosis catch. Team A and Team B have the same quantity
  score, but Team B has a higher quality score.
