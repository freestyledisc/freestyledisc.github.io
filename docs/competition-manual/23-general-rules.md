# 2.3 General Rules

## 2.3.1 Judges can only evaluate what they see
Judges should evaluate only what they see occur. There are times when a judge may miss part of a move or move
combination. This may occur, for example, in a multiple disc routine. Judges should not assume they know what
they missed or ask another judge to relate to them what they missed. Judges should instead evaluate only the
parts of a move or move combination that they see.

## 2.3.2 Non-disc skills
Some freestyle teams may include non-disc elements in their routines, like dancing or gymnastics. Judges should
avoid rewarding teams for these elements. Teams should receive points only for elements that relate to the disc or
also require some disc skills. If for instance, a team includes a dancing section of their routine that does not
include disc-related skills, that team should not receive points in any category.
Teams may receive execution errors, however, for the non-disc components. Judges should not otherwise penalize
teams for performing non-disc skills in the absence of execution errors.
