# Bonus Points Distribution

Whenever a player beats another player ranked in the current top 200, he/she receives Bonus Points in
addition to Open Ranking Points. Bonus points are not awarded for the Women's Rankings list. Bonus
Points are only awarded for players directly beaten. In other words, the player has to be in the same
pool as the beaten player, and the beaten player has to be eliminated from contention. If more than one
division at a tournament counts toward the Open Rankings, divide the Bonus Points by the number of
divisions. The exception to this rule is the FPA Worlds open divisions. Full bonus points are counted for
both divisions.
