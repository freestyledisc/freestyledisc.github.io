# Rankings Explained

Every tournament uses the Regular point scales unless categorized differently by the FPA Board. A
Regular tournament needs at least twenty total entrants to receive 100% of its points. Other point scales
are proportionally higher or lower based on their impact/importance.

Regular tournaments with 15-19 competitors are worth 80% of the base scale. Regular tournaments
with 10-14 entrants are worth 65% of the base scale. Regular tournaments with 4-9 competitors are
worth 50% of the base scale.

Pro tournaments (currently WFDF, AFO and EFO) are worth 120% of the base scale. (For reference
historically, WFDF and US Open championships at one time were worth 140% of the base scale)
For all tournaments except FPAW, all open divisions share the allocated points. For instance, if a
tournament hosts both pairs and co-op competitions, pairs receives 50% of the points and co-op the
other 50%, and bonus points are similarly allocated. Points for pairs would be added to points for co-op
to arrive at a player's ranking points for the tournament. Open ranking points are only awarded for open
division categories. Open rankings bonus points only are awarded for womenâ€™s and mixed pairs
categories.

Each division of the FPA Worlds is worth 160% of the base scale. Each division of the FPA Worlds is
counted as a separate event toward the freestyle flying disc rankings.
