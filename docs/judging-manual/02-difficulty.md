# 2.1.1 General
Judges should score the moves that are attempted as well as what is completed. Consider the relative risk of the
moves. If a reasonable attempt is made but the disc is dropped, it should receive a slightly lower score than if the
player had caught the disc. If the attempt falls far short of completion, the difficulty score should be adjusted
accordingly, but judges are asked to remember that execution is a separate score.

# 2.1.2 Time Block Scoring
Difficulty is scored in 15-second blocks. Every 15 seconds, a recording will sound "Mark." Write down one score
that reflects both the most difficult moves attempted in the preceding 15 seconds and the total difficulty
attempted in that period. Ideally, the score is given after a natural break in play (a phrase that ends in a catch,
drop, or pause) so that the score reflects completed combinations and marking the score will not distract the
judge from the routine. The judge may wait a moment for a natural break after the "Mark" sounds if it is
necessary but should be mindful not to wait very long into the next block. Use the whole 0-10 scale. At the end of
the time allotted for the routine, the recording will sound "Time." Do not consider any risk/difficulty demonstrated
after "Time" is called.

## Difficulty scale
Time blocks are scored on a scale from 0-10. The scores should be interpreted as follows:
0:No tricks
1-2:Very easy tricks
3-4:Easy tricks
5-6:Average tricks
7-8:Difficult tricks
9-10: Very difficult tricks

# 2.1.3 Extra points for consecutivity
When assigning the difficulty score for the previous time block, judges should consider the level of consecutivity (a
detailed description and examples of the concept of consecutivity can be found in the appendix of this document).
Write a “+” above each time block score for above-average consecutivity.

# 2.1.4 Calculating the overall difficulty score
Cross-out the lowest time block score and add up the remaining time blocks. Add a point to the time block total for
each “+” on the difficulty sheet for the routine. Divide by the total number of remaining time blocks, then multiply
the result by 1.5 and round to the nearest tenth of a point.
